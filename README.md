# InstagramStats
Lighthouse Labs Midterm Project - By Marc Maguire, Alex Mitchell and Adam Felix

Timeline: 
- Ideation and initial research began on Saturday May 28th at 10:00AM. 
- by 3:00 PM on the 28th we had decided to move forward with the Instagram Dashboard idea.
- We presented the app less than 6 days later on June 2nd at 2:00 PM.

During our time in the iOS Immersive Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs, Alex, Adam and I teamed up to test out the knowledge
we gained through the first 4 weeks of the program. When we sat down to plan out this project, we came up with the
following goals:

1) Consume an API (We went with Instagram).
2) Utilize a third party framework with Cocoa Pods (Instagram Kit).
3) Persist our data (We used Core Data).
4) Show a solid understanding of what we learned about the iOS SDK - MapKit, UIKit, nav controllers, tableViews, passing data,
   Core Graphics, gesture recognizers and asynchronus network requests.
5) Control the scope of the project so that we arrive at a MVP 24 hours prior to our presentation, allowing us to polish the      UI as much as possible.

The Result:
An Instagram Analytics Dashboard that accesses your Instagram statistics through their (heavily sandboxed) API. Then we displayed
information in a visually pleasing way, allowing users to compare likes and comments on each of their photos while seeing where
the photos were taken.

Moving forward:
- finish tweaking initial network call
- update Autolayout constraints
- add refresh function with progress wheel / icon to wait for the network
- get approval to move off of sandbox if we want to implement further statistics
